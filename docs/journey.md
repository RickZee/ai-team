# The project's background and ongoing story

## Why I created this project

My wife and I were talking about advancements of agentic systems and their use in large corporations or government organizations.

I decided to make a quick prototype for how such system would like like.

## Approach

I am using a combination of AI tools:

* SuperGrok for quick research, since I don't have any limits on tokens
* Claude Code to create in-depth architecture documents and plans
* Cursor for executing the plans and implementing the system

## Journey

### Fab 15

Created the initial plans and prompts. Opus 4.5 created very nicely designed build plan and initial prompts.

The problem was - I started running them in cursor only to realize that Claude didn't really do a good job:

So now I have gaps in implementation and need to start from scratch.

Also there is way to run multiple agents in Cursor in parallel.
